This summarizes the extreme value in ghostwriting.

All of the world’s smartest people spend 20, 30, 40+ years working in their respective industries acquiring obscene amounts of highly valuable knowledge: problem-solving frameworks, strategies, pattern recognition, trend analysis, etc. And the vast majority of them retire without ever passing along that knowledge to others in a scalable way. Maybe they share their nuggets of wisdom with a few employees or business partners. But eventually, those people retire too—and the cycle continues. All of this knowledge just disappears from the world. This is the value of ghostwriting to the client: **the client has an abundance of knowledge, but a scarcity of time.** And without help, their stories, insights, frameworks, and perspectives are never going to get outside their brain.

Benefit #1: You get paid to learn.

Ghostwriting is a life hack for getting paid to learn from experts in their fields.

Our very first client at my ghostwriting agency was the founder of a company that brokered multimillion-dollar deals between celebrities and big brands. (He put us on hold halfway through our first content call because “Warren” was on the other line—as in Warren Buffet.)

For 30 minutes, we got to ask this guy any and every question we could think of: “How did you first start your company? What advice would you give to other entrepreneurs who want to get into branded partnerships? What makes an effective branded partnership? What do you do when a branded partnership goes wrong? How do you find the right celebrity for each brand campaign? What was it like working with Jay-Z?” We learned so much. This is a guy who would routinely charge brands upwards of $50,000 for an hour of consulting. And instead, at the end of the call, we sent him an invoice.

“I’ll have my accounting team process this right away. Thanks for the call guys,” he said, and then hung up. My co-founder and I looked at each other like we’d just robbed a bank and gotten away with it

For years, I thought I needed to “find my voice” as a writer. And what ghostwriting taught me is that you don’t “find” your voice. You create it.

A voice is just a combination of identifiable attributes. These attributes can include, but are not limited to: word choice, cadence and rhythm, structure and format, even the decision to use (or not use) data to back up an opinion.
