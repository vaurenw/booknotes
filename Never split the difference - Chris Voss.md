Chapter 2 - Be a mirror

■ A good negotiator prepares, going in, to be
ready for possible surprises; a great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal the surprises she is certain to find.
■ Don’t commit to assumptions; instead, view
them as hypotheses and use the negotiation to test them rigorously.
■ People who view negotiation as a battle of
arguments become overwhelmed by the voices in their head. Negotiation is not an act of battle; it’s a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much information as possible.
■ To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole
and all-encompassing focus the other person and
what they have to say.
■ Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the
mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If
we’re too much in a hurry, people can feel as if
they’re not being heard. You risk undermining
the rapport and trust you’ve built.
■ Put a smile on your face. When people are in a
positive frame of mind, they think more quickly,
and are more likely to collaborate and problem solve (instead of fight and resist). Positivity creates mental agility in both you and your
counterpart.
There are three voice tones available to negotiators:
1. The late-night FM DJ voice: Use selectively to
make a point. Inflect your voice downward,
keeping it calm and slow. When done properly,
you create an aura of authority and
trustworthiness without triggering defensiveness.
2. The positive/playful voice: Should be your
default voice. It’s the voice of an easygoing,
good-natured person. Your attitude is light and
encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile
while you’re talking.
3. The direct or assertive voice: Used rarely. Will
cause problems and create pushback.
■ Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words
(or the critical one to three words) of what
someone has just said. We fear what’s different
and are drawn to what’s similar. Mirroring is the
art of insinuating similarity, which facilitates
bonding. Use mirrors to encourage the other side
to empathize and bond with you, keep people
talking, buy your side time to regroup, and
encourage your counterparts to reveal their
strategy.

Chapter 3 - Don't feel their pain, label it

■ Imagine yourself in your counterpart’s situation.
The beauty of empathy is that it doesn’t demand
that you agree with the other person’s ideas (you
may well find them crazy). But by
acknowledging the other person’s situation, you
immediately convey that you are listening. And
once they know that you are listening, they may
tell you something that you can use.
■ The reasons why a counterpart will not make an
agreement with you are often more powerful
than why they will make a deal, so focus first on
clearing the barriers to agreement. Denying
barriers or negative influences gives them
credence; get them into the open.
■ Pause. After you label a barrier or mirror a
statement, let it sink in. Don’t worry, the other
party will fill the silence.
■ Label your counterpart’s fears to diffuse their
power. We all want to talk about the happy stuff,
but remember, the faster you interrupt action in
your counterpart’s amygdala, the part of the
brain that generates fear, the faster you can
generate feelings of safety, well-being, and trust.
■ List the worst things that the other party could
say about you and say them before the other
person can. Performing an accusation audit in
advance prepares you to head off negative
dynamics before they take root. And because
these accusations often sound exaggerated when
said aloud, speaking them will encourage the
other person to claim that quite the opposite is
true.
■ Remember you’re dealing with a person who
wants to be appreciated and understood. So use
labels to reinforce and encourage positive
perceptions and dynamics.

Chapter 4 - Beware yes, master no

■ Break the habit of attempting to get people to say
“yes.” Being pushed for “yes” makes people
defensive. Our love of hearing “yes” makes us
blind to the defensiveness we ourselves feel
when someone is pushing us to say it.
■ “No” is not a failure. We have learned that “No”
is the anti-“Yes” and therefore a word to be
avoided at all costs. But it really often just means
“Wait” or “I’m not comfortable with that.” Learn
how to hear it calmly. It is not the end of the
negotiation, but the beginning.
■ “Yes” is the final goal of a negotiation, but don’t
aim for it at the start. Asking someone for “Yes”
too quickly in a conversation—“Do you like to
drink water, Mr. Smith?”—gets his guard up and
paints you as an untrustworthy salesman.
■ Saying “No” makes the speaker feel safe, secure,
and in control, so trigger it. By saying what they
don’t want, your counterpart defines their space
and gains the confidence and comfort to listen to
you. That’s why “Is now a bad time to talk?” is
always better than “Do you have a few minutes
to talk?”
■ Sometimes the only way to get your counterpart
to listen and engage with you is by forcing them
into a “No.” That means intentionally
mislabeling one of their emotions or desires or
asking a ridiculous question—like, “It seems like
you want this project to fail”—that can only be
answered negatively.
■ Negotiate in their world. Persuasion is not about
how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It’s
about the other party convincing themselves that
the solution you want is their own idea. So don’t
beat them with logic or brute force. Ask them
questions that open paths to your goals. It’s not
about you.
■ If a potential business partner is ignoring you,
contact them with a clear and concise “No”-
oriented question that suggests that you are ready
to walk away. “Have you given up on this
project?” works wonders.

Chapter 5 - Trigger the two words that immediately transform any negotiation

■ Creating unconditional positive regard opens the
door to changing thoughts and behaviors.
Humans have an innate urge toward socially
constructive behavior. The more a person feels
understood, and positively affirmed in that
understanding, the more likely that urge for
constructive behavior will take hold.
■ “That’s right” is better than “yes.” Strive for it.
Reaching “that’s right” in a negotiation creates
breakthroughs.
■ Use a summary to trigger a “that’s right.” The
building blocks of a good summary are a label
combined with paraphrasing. Identify,
rearticulate, and emotionally affirm “the world
according to . . .”

Chapter 6 - Bend their reality

■ All negotiations are defined by a network of
subterranean desires and needs. Don’t let
yourself be fooled by the surface. Once you
know that the Haitian kidnappers just want party
money, you will be miles better prepared.
■ Splitting the difference is wearing one black and
one brown shoe, so don’t compromise. Meeting
halfway often leads to bad deals for both sides.
■ Approaching deadlines entice people to rush the
negotiating process and do impulsive things that
are against their best interests.
■ The F-word—“Fair”—is an emotional term
people usually exploit to put the other side on the
defensive and gain concessions. When your
counterpart drops the F-bomb, don’t get
suckered into a concession. Instead, ask them to
explain how you’re mistreating them.
■ You can bend your counterpart’s reality by
anchoring his starting point. Before you make an
offer, emotionally anchor them by saying how
bad it will be. When you get to numbers, set an
extreme anchor to make your “real” offer seem
reasonable, or use a range to seem less
aggressive. The real value of anything depends
on what vantage point you’re looking at it from.
■ People will take more risks to avoid a loss than
to realize a gain. Make sure your counterpart sees
that there is something to lose by inaction.

Chapter 7 - Create the illusion of control

■ Don’t try to force your opponent to admit that
you are right. Aggressive confrontation is the
enemy of constructive negotiation.
■ Avoid questions that can be answered with
“Yes” or tiny pieces of information. These
require little thought and inspire the human need
for reciprocity; you will be expected to give
something back.
■ Ask calibrated questions that start with the words
“How” or “What.” By implicitly asking the other
party for help, these questions will give your
counterpart an illusion of control and will inspire
them to speak at length, revealing important
information.
■ Don’t ask questions that start with “Why” unless
you want your counterpart to defend a goal that
serves you. “Why” is always an accusation, in
any language.
■ Calibrate your questions to point your
counterpart toward solving your problem. This
will encourage them to expend their energy on
devising a solution.
■ Bite your tongue. When you’re attacked in a
negotiation, pause and avoid angry emotional
reactions. Instead, ask your counterpart a
calibrated question.
■ There is always a team on the other side. If you
are not influencing those behind the table, you
are vulnerable.

Chapter 8 - Guarantee execution

■ Ask calibrated “How” questions, and ask them
again and again. Asking “How” keeps your
counterparts engaged but off balance. Answering
the questions will give them the illusion of
control. It will also lead them to contemplate
your problems when making their demands.
■ Use “How” questions to shape the negotiating
environment. You do this by using “How can I
do that?” as a gentle version of “No.” This will
subtly push your counterpart to search for other
solutions—your solutions. And very often it will
get them to bid against themselves.
■ Don’t just pay attention to the people you’re
negotiating with directly; always identify the
motivations of the players “behind the table.”
You can do so by asking how a deal will affect
everybody else and how on board they are.
■ Follow the 7-38-55 Percent Rule by paying close
attention to tone of voice and body language.
Incongruence between the words and nonverbal
signs will show when your counterpart is lying or
uncomfortable with a deal.
■ Is the “Yes” real or counterfeit? Test it with the
Rule of Three: use calibrated questions,
summaries, and labels to get your counterpart to
reaffirm their agreement at least three times. It’s
really hard to repeatedly lie or fake conviction.
■ A person’s use of pronouns offers deep insights
into his or her relative authority. If you’re
hearing a lot of “I,” “me,” and “my,” the real
power to decide probably lies elsewhere. Picking
up a lot of “we,” “they,” and “them,” it’s more
likely you’re dealing directly with a savvy
decision maker keeping his options open.
■ Use your own name to make yourself a real
person to the other side and even get your own
personal discount. Humor and humanity are the
best ways to break the ice and remove
roadblocks. 

Chapter 9 - Bargain hard

■ Identify your counterpart’s negotiating style.
Once you know whether they are
Accommodator, Assertive, or Analyst, you’ll
know the correct way to approach them.
■ Prepare, prepare, prepare. When the pressure is
on, you don’t rise to the occasion; you fall to
your highest level of preparation. So design an
ambitious but legitimate goal and then game out
the labels, calibrated questions, and responses
you’ll use to get there. That way, once you’re at
the bargaining table, you won’t have to wing it.
■ Get ready to take a punch. Kick-ass negotiators
usually lead with an extreme anchor to knock
you off your game. If you’re not ready, you’ll
flee to your maximum without a fight. So prepare
your dodging tactics to avoid getting sucked into
the compromise trap.
■ Set boundaries, and learn to take a punch or
punch back, without anger. The guy across the
table is not the problem; the situation is.
■ Prepare an Ackerman plan. Before you head into
the weeds of bargaining, you’ll need a plan of
extreme anchor, calibrated questions, and well-defined offers. 
Remember: 65, 85, 95, 100
percent. Decreasing raises and ending on
nonround numbers will get your counterpart to
believe that he’s squeezing you for all you’re
worth when you’re really getting to the number
you want.

Chapter 10 - Find the black swan

■ Let what you know—your known knowns
—guide you but not blind you. Every case is
new, so remain flexible and adaptable.
Remember the Griffin bank crisis: no hostagetaker had killed a hostage on deadline, until he did.
■ Black Swans are leverage multipliers. Remember
the three types of leverage: positive (the ability to
give someone what they want); negative (the
ability to hurt someone); and normative (using
your counterpart’s norms to bring them around).
■ Work to understand the other side’s “religion.”
Digging into worldviews inherently implies
moving beyond the negotiating table and into the
life, emotional and otherwise, of your
counterpart. That’s where Black Swans live.
■ Review everything you hear from your
counterpart. You will not hear everything the
first time, so double-check. Compare notes with
team members. Use backup listeners whose job
is to listen between the lines. They will hear
things you miss.
■ Exploit the similarity principle. People are more
apt to concede to someone they share a cultural
similarity with, so dig for what makes them tick
and show that you share common ground.
■ When someone seems irrational or crazy, they
most likely aren’t. Faced with this situation,
search for constraints, hidden desires, and bad
information.
■ Get face time with your counterpart. Ten minutes
of face time often reveals more than days of
research. Pay special attention to your
counterpart’s verbal and nonverbal
communication at unguarded moments—at the
beginning and the end of the session or when
someone says something out of line.
