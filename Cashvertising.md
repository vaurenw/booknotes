“This teacup, like your mind, is so full of ideas that there is no room for new information. You must first empty your head before any new knowledge can enter.”

**Bottom line:** This book will help you make more money

**Question:** When you walk into a car dealership, do you really think
you’re simply having an everyday chat with the sales rep? Sorry, you’re
not. A skilled salesperson is a master in psychological communication
strategies. Chances are, you are not. And it’s the salesperson’s goal to
move you from “looker” to “buyer.”
You see, while you’re shooting the breeze, admiring the beautiful,
shiny paint, breathing in the aromatic leather upholstery, and drooling
over the 550-horsepower engine, that “nice” salesperson is reading you
like a book.
Like it or not, he’s pulling you through a series of deliciously persuasive steps that are rapidly and continually being tailored to your
every response—and you’re not even noticing! (Why did I just say pulling
you rather than taking you? Was it intentional? Oh yes. I’ll explain in
detail, later in this book.) If you say A, he’ll say B. If instead you say C,
he’ll jump to D. There’s little you can do to surprise him. He’s seen it
all before.
**Listen:** His goal is not to be your friend. It’s also not to whittle away
his day with pleasant chatter. His goal is for you to sign a hardcore,
legally binding contract—the act that puts money in his pocket and
food on his table.

The Life-Force 8
Human beings are biologically programmed with the following eight
desires:
1. Survival, enjoyment of life, life extension.
2. Enjoyment of food and beverages.
3. Freedom from fear, pain, and danger.
4. Sexual companionship.
5. Comfortable living conditions.
6. To be superior, winning, keeping up with the Joneses.
7. Care and protection of loved ones.
8. Social approval.

These are called secondary, or learned
wants, and nine have been identified:
1. To be informed.
2. Curiosity.
3. Cleanliness of body and surroundings.
4. Efficiency.
5. Convenience.
6. Dependability/quality.
7. Expression of beauty and style.
8. Economy/profit.
9. Bargains.
These secondary wants are strong, but they don’t even come close
to the LF8. They’re way in the background, completely clouded by your
LF8 dust. We’re not born with these secondary wants. We learned them.

So here’s the simple formula for desire, and the result it sets in motion:
Tension → Desire → Action to Satisfy the Desire
In short, when you appeal to people’s LF8 desires, you create a
drive that motivates them to take an action that will fulfill that desire as
soon as possible

Let’s first look at comparison, which is similar to group persuasion— or the bandwagon effect—and is an extremely potent weapon in your advertising armory. The question, **“Everybody else is doing it, why aren’t you?”** exerts a powerful effect on consumers. Human psychology teaches us that no one likes to be left out, and that we’re all driven by a need to belong


Remember my client Jay Siff of Moving Targets? He sends his prospects a four-page full-color brochure called “101 Success Stories.” It contains—you guessed it—101 testimonials and photographs from clients who rave about his service. It impossible to not be impressed by this brochure. Even if you didn’t read the rest of the information that accompanies this sales piece, you’d be instantly inclined to believe that the service he promotes actually works. Not only does it work like gangbusters—and yes, it really does—but even 101 people said so!

# The Power of Questions

*What kind of questions?* Any kind! Just look at the writing in this book. You’ll see many examples of this ploy. *What does it do?* (The last sentence is a perfect example.) It causes your prospects to desire the answer. So what happens? They continue reading to find out the answer. I love this technique. *Why?* Because it works like a lure to help me capture greater readership. Use it in headlines. Use it in subheads. And of course, us it in your body copy.
