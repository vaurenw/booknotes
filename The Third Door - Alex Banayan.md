“Speaking of pictures, rule number three: Mystery makes history. When you’re doing cool shit, don’t post pictures of it on Facebook. No one actually changing the world posts everything they do online. Keep people guessing what you’re up to. Plus, the people you’re going to impress by posting things online aren’t the people you should care about impressing.  
  
I nodded, then admitted to Elliott that sometimes when I cold-called someone, I’d get so nervous I’d forget what to say. “It’s because you’re overthinking it,” he said. “Just tell yourself you’re calling your friend, dial the number, and start talking right away. The best cure for nervousness is immediate action.  
  
“Persistence—it’s a cliché, but it happens to work. The person who makes it is the person who keeps on going after everyone else has quit. This is more important than intelligence, pedigree, even connections. Be dogged! Keep hitting that door until you bust it down!” —JERRY WEINTRAUB “Energy and persistence conquer all things.” —BENJAMIN FRANKLIN “The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.” —THOMAS EDISON “You just can’t beat the person who never gives up.” —BABE RUTH “My success is based on persistence, not luck.” —ESTÉE LAUDER “It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.” —ALBERT EINSTEIN “We can do anything we want to do if we stick to it long enough.” —HELEN KELLER “If you are going through hell, keep going.” —WINSTON CHURCHILL “Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence.” —CALVIN COOLIDGE  
  
The potential to unlock your future is in your hands—but first you have to pick up the damn phone.  
  
The founder of TED had told me, “I live my life by two mantras. One: if you don’t ask, you don’t get. And two: most things don’t work out.”  
  
“You can’t get an A if you’re afraid of getting an F,” Quincy added. “It’s amazing, the psychology of growing in your field, no matter what you do. Growth comes from mistakes. You have to cherish them, so you can learn from them. Your mistakes are your greatest gift.”  
  
I’d always seen success and failure as opposites, but now I could see they were just different results of the same thing—trying. I swore to myself that from now on I would be unattached to succeeding, and unattached to failing. Instead, I would be attached to trying, to growing.  
  
As my thoughts continued to unfold, a quote came to mind, from a seemingly unexpected source. It was from one of the Harry Potter books. At a critical moment in the story, Dumbledore says, “It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”  
  
Everyone has the power to make little choices that can alter their lives forever. You can either choose to give in to inertia and continue waiting in line for the First Door, or you can choose to jump out of line, run down the alley, and take the Third Door. We all have that choice. If there was one lesson I learned from my journey, it’s that making these choices was possible. It’s that mindset of possibility that transformed my life. Because when you change what you believe is possible, you change what becomes possible.
